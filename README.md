### [Message Parser]

The message parser controls what happens when the user sends a message.

You have to implement this yourself. The beauty of this is that you can make the message parsing as complex or as simple as you'd like.

The only method that the message parser needs to implement is the "parse" method. This method is called inside the chatbot when it receives a message from the user.

### [Action Provider] 

The actionprovider controls what kind of action that the chatbot is going to perform.

The actionprovider is given the createChatBotMessage and createClientMessage functions in the constructor, which you can use to create a new responses.

### [Widgets]

Widgets are custom components that you can render with chatbot messages.

In order to use widgets, you need to register them in the config. Here you will define the following properties:

widgetName - defines the name of the widget

widgetFunc - define a function that returns the component. The function must take props and spread it into the component.

mapStateToProps - defines which state properties you defined in config should be injected into the widget component.

props - option array of props you want to pass to your component.

When the widget component is rendered it will receive the following props:

actionProvider - the actionprovider class you have defined, so you can trigger other actions from your custom components.

setState - setState function that can manipulate the top level chatbot state.

scrollIntoView - helper function to scroll content into view when doing asynchronous calls, use in combination with useEffect when updating to state to ensure that the chat window is scrolled to bottom.

[state] - any piece of state you defined in the mapStateToProps section of the config.

[props] - any piece of props you defined in the props section of the config.
